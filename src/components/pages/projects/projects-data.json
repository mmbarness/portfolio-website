    "longDescription": "The idea was borne from wanting to play pickup sports without really knowing how to join. Sometimes it can all feel a little clique-y, and this app aims to change that. MERN stack project that incorporates Google Maps API.",
    "partTwoTitle": "See the games happening near you",
    "partTwoDescription": "This was a team effort, so I didn't work on every feature. Since I was team lead, I tended to focus on what might otherwise fall through the cracks. In this case, that was address search. I enjoyed implementing it, and made sure to do so as a functional component that easily slots within other components. This enabled us to use it with no revisions both where you see it here and within the user signup form.",

    "partThreeDescription": "Another component I worked on. The user page shows all events they've indicated they're attending, and allows them to unjoin if they like. If they do, the event disappears from the page like you'd expect, thanks to my canny implementation of useEffect.",

You might, for example, think 'DeNiro' when you hear 'Scorsese', when you should really be thinking 'Schoonmaker'. Director's acquire reputations for the actors' they work with, and for good reason, but Call Sheet reveals that nine times out of ten, it's the crew they work with that they have the longest-lasting relationships with.",

    "partTwoDescription": "Any director in the TMDB database - the same one used by letterboxd - is searchable.
